## Project Overview
Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) involves detecting and recognizing license plates from images or video footage. This project combines YOLOv8 for fast and accurate vehicle and license plate detection with LPRNet for efficient character recognition. The developed system is versatile, providing a structured approach for traffic management, automated tolling, and security applications.

## Motivation
The need for streamlined, automated solutions in vehicle monitoring, toll collection, and parking management motivated the development of this ALPR model. Through the integration of deep learning and computer vision, this project minimizes human intervention, reduces errors, and increases system efficiency.

## Features
- **License Plate Detection:** Uses YOLOv8 to identify and localize license plates within detected vehicles.
- **Character Recognition:** Extracts and recognizes alphanumeric characters on license plates using LPRNet.
- **Vehicle Tracking:** Enables continuous monitoring and tracking of vehicles in real-time.
- **Data Export:** Aggregates and exports recognized data (e.g., vehicle tracking IDs, license plate texts) to CSV files.
- **Scalable and Adaptable:** Can be extended to various applications beyond toll collection and parking management.

## System Architecture
The system processes video or image input through sequential stages:
1. **Vehicle Detection:** YOLOv8 identifies vehicles and their locations.
2. **License Plate Detection:** YOLOv8 identifies license plate regions within vehicles.
3. **Character Recognition:** LPRNet extracts and recognizes the characters on the detected license plates.
4. **Data Structuring:** The results are organized and saved for easy access and integration with other systems.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** PyTorch or TensorFlow
- **Libraries:** OpenCV for image processing, Ultralytics for YOLOv8 model implementation
- **Dataset:** Trained on CCPD (Chinese City Parking Dataset) and other relevant datasets

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ALPR_Model.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Download and prepare the dataset.**
4. **Run the model:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
The model can be run on both live and recorded video feeds. Modify the input source in the `config.py` file and execute `main.py` to begin license plate detection and recognition.

## Limitations and Future Enhancements
### Limitations
- Reduced accuracy in adverse conditions (e.g., poor lighting, occlusions).
- Dependency on high-quality video input for reliable results.

### Future Enhancements
- Train on a more diverse dataset to improve generalization across regions.
- Incorporate temporal analysis for better tracking.
- Develop a mobile application for enhanced user accessibility.
